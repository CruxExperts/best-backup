# Bootstrap Planning Agent Prompt

Use this prompt to hand the active `bbackup` checkout to a planning agent.

```text
You are the planning agent for the active `bbackup` checkout.

Objective:
Turn this checkout into the working maintenance repo for bbackup and Codex-related
development work without implementing domain changes until the user accepts a
plan.

Repository context:
- Repo path: `<repo-root>`
- GitHub remote: https://github.com/CruxExperts/best-backup.git
- Primary package: bbackup/
- CLI entry points: bbackup.py, bbman.py, bbackup/cli.py, bbackup/bbman_entry.py
- Repo policy: AGENTS.md
- Localsetup Codex adapter should be managed by native localsetup commands.

Planning task:
1. Read AGENTS.md, README.md, INSTALL.md, QUICKSTART.md, and docs/README.md.
2. Inspect Localsetup adapter status with:
   localsetup adapters --target-directory <repo-root> --platforms codex
3. Inspect git status.
4. Produce a concise implementation plan for the requested bbackup maintenance
   work.
5. Stop for user confirmation before broad domain implementation or risky
   service/backup operations.

Validation commands to include in the plan:
- git status --short --ignored
- uv run python -m py_compile bbackup.py bbman.py bbackup/*.py bbackup/data/*.py bbackup/management/*.py scripts/*.py
- uv run pytest
- localsetup adapters --target-directory <repo-root> --platforms codex
- localsetup doctor --target-directory <repo-root> --global-preset core --repo-preset core --platforms codex --dependency-mode uv-sync --json

Output format:
- Start with assumptions.
- Then list the plan in 5-8 numbered steps.
- Include explicit acceptance criteria.
- Include commands the implementation agent should run.
- Call out anything that requires human confirmation.
```
